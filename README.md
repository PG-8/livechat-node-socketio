# livechat-node-socketio

Simple live chat app created using Node and Socket.io

In the gif below, you can see swapping between my browser's windows. The purpose was to emulate multiple connections to the same localhost. Works with any number of devices connected to the same network and localhost's port.

**The goal of this app was to write as little code as possible while deploying a functioning basic live chat. I may or may not go back to this repo and add functionalities or styling.**
